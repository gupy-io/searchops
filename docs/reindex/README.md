# Background

In a blog post from 2013 [Elastic explained how to perform a mapping migration
without downtime][1]. The process has been much facilitated by the [2016 release
of the Reindex API][2], but the overall strategy reproduced [here][3] and
[there][4] is basically the same:

1. Create an alias for the old index
2. Alter application clients to target the alias
3. Create the new index
4. Reindex data from old index to new index
5. Atomically update the alias to point to new index
6. Remove old index

But [several][5] [others][6] [have][7] [noticed][8] that there are extra steps
to take care of what happens with reads and writes requests that arrive during
the migration process, specially considering that the Reindex operation might
take a while. "Zero Downtime" means you won't be getting
`index_not_found_exception` errors, but for some applications that's far from
enough.
