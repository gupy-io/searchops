# Architecture Decision History

Welcome üëã to the architecture decision history of `searchops`. You will find
here all the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) of the project.

You can browse the ADRs by using the left menu or the search bar.

## Definition and Purpose

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a
requirement that is architecturally significant. An Architectural Decision
Record (ADR) is a document that captures a single AD. The collection of ADRs
created and maintained in a project constitutes its decision history.

The typical workflow of an ADR is the following:

After leaving draft status, an ADR is immutable (only its status can change).
That way, you can become familiar with the whole project history just by reading
its decision history in chronological order.

Maintaining this documentation aims at:

- ü§ù Formalizing the decision process of the team
- üî≠ Avoiding blind acceptance/reversal of a past decisions
- üöÄ Improving and speeding up the onboarding of a new team member
